% the ; denotes going to a new row
A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9; 10, 11, 12]

% Initialize a vector
v = [1;2;3]

% Get the dimension of the matrix A where m = rows and n = columns
[m,n] = size(A)

% store dimension
dim_A = size(A)

% get dimension of vector v
dim_v = size(v)

% ndex into the 2nd row 3rd column of matrix A
A_23 = A(2,3)

% Addition and Scalar Multiplication
% Initialize matrix A and B 
A = [1, 2, 4; 5, 3, 2]
B = [1, 3, 4; 1, 1, 1]

% Initialize constant s 
s = 2

% See how element-wise addition works
add_AB = A + B 

% See how element-wise subtraction works
sub_AB = A - B

% See how scalar multiplication works
mult_As = A * s

% Divide A by s
div_As = A / s

% What happens if we have a Matrix + scalar?
add_As = A + s

% Matrix Vector Multiplication
% Initialize matrix A 
A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6;7, 8, 9] 

% Initialize vector v 
v = [1; 1; 1] 

% Multiply A * v
Av = A * v

% Matrix Matrix Multiplication
% Initialize a 3 by 2 matrix 
A = [1, 2; 3, 4;5, 6]

% Initialize a 2 by 1 matrix 
B = [1; 2] 

% We expect a resulting matrix of (3 by 2)*(2 by 1) = (3 by 1) 
mult_AB = A*B
